# Project 2: Triple Peaks Coffee Shop

This project is the second project of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It is a website for a coffee shop located in the Triple Peaks Library. The website was developed using up to date HTML and CSS techniques such as BEM methodology, adhering to best practices in web development.

## Project Features

- **Semantic HTML5:** Ensures accessibility and meaningful structure of the webpage.
- **Flexbox Layout:** Utilized for responsive and flexible layouts.
- **Flat BEM File Structure:** Organized CSS following the Block-Element-Modifier methodology for scalability and maintainability.
- **Custom Form:** A reservation form allows users to book a table at the coffee shop.
- **CSS Animation:** Interactive and decorative animations (e.g., pulsating circle in the "About" section).
- **Responsive Design:** The site adapts to various screen sizes and devices.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**
- **CSS3**
- **Google Fonts**
- **Normalize.css**

## Plans for Improvement

1. **Add More Animations:**
   - Include hover and focus effects for interactivity.
   - Add subtle animations to the navigation bar and form elements.

2. **User Reviews Section:**
   - Create a section where customers can leave and view reviews about the coffee shop.

3. **Interactive Menu with Filtering Options**
   - Add an interactive menu that enables users to filter items by category (e.g., coffee, tea, baked goods) or dietary preferences (e.g., vegan, gluten-free) and place orders in advance. This feature will improve usability and provide a more personalized experience.
